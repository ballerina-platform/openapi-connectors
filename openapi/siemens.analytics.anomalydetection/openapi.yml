  description: >-
    This is a generated connector from [Siemens Analytics Anomaly Detection API](https://developer.mindsphere.io/apis/analytics-anomalydetection/api-anomalydetection-overview.html) OpenAPI Specification.

    The Anomaly Detection Service aims to automatically detect unexpected behaviour of processes and assets using time series data and provides API to train model and use it for
    anomaly detection. In the Interactive mode Analytic Model Management service is used as model storage. Model expiration date is set to 14 days.
  version: 3.4.0
  x-visibility: external
  x-ballerina-init-description: >
    The connector initialization requires setting the API credentials. 

    Create a [Siemens MindSphere](https://siemens.mindsphere.io/en) account and
    obtain tokens by following [this
    guide](https://developer.mindsphere.io/concepts/concept-roles-scopes.html#iot-file-service). For accessing this service you need to have the respective roles listed in [Analytics roles and scopes](https://developer.mindsphere.io/concepts/concept-roles-scopes.html#analytics-services)
