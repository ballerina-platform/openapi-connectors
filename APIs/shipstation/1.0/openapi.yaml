        Webhooks can be viewed & edited via the ShipStation Application under Integrations in the [**Account Settings**](https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/integrations).
        NOTE: Webhooks will be sent to the URL specified in the ``target_url``. The HTTP request will be sent via POST and will contain a [**webhook JSON object**](https://www.shipstation.com/developer-api/#/reference/model-webhook) in the body.
        The body of this request to subscribe has the following attributes:
        Name               |Data Type          |Description
        -------------------|-------------------|-------------------
        ``target_url``  | string, required | The URL to send the webhooks to
        ``event`` | string, required | The type of webhook to subscribe to. Must contain one of the following values: ORDER_NOTIFY, ITEM_ORDER_NOTIFY, SHIP_NOTIFY, ITEM_SHIP_NOTIFY
        ``store_id`` | int, optional | If passed in, the webhooks will only be triggered for this ``store_id``
