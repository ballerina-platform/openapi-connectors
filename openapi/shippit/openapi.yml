They remain in the New Orders page until you call either the Book API or click the Label button.\r\n\r\n#### Priority Order Lifecycle\r\n| Web UI action | API call     | State on completion         | Where seen in UI   |\r\n|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\r\n| N/A           | POST order   | Packing order               | New Orders page    |\r\n| Label         | GET label    | Booked                      | Track page         |\r\n| Cancel order  | DELETE order | Cancelled                   | not visible        |\r\n\r\nUnlike standard / express orders, priority orders do not need the book call. They are automatically booked by Shippit on the delivery date.\r\n\r\nPriority orders will remain on the New Orders page until dismissed by clicking the Label button or the GET label API call is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Order validation\r\nIf the `validate` field is passed and set to `true`, then the order is not saved unless Shippit can validate the destination suburb and postcode to be a valid combination. If a valid combination is not found, Shippit will return a suggested address.\r\n\r\n### Manual or Automatic Courier selection\r\nYou can allocate a courier to an order in one of two ways: you can manually specify the courier as part of the order, or you can allow Shippit to automatically allocate a courier for you.\r\n\r\nTo manually specify a courier, pass the `courier_allocation` field with the identifier of the courier (see below).\r\n\r\nTo have Shippit allocate the courier for you, pass the `courier_type` field to specify the type of couriers that Shippit can choose from to allocate for you. This is used to stand for a service level such as `standard`, `express`, `priority`, `click_and_collect`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Specifying Parcels and Products\r\nShippit needs to know the specifications of the products you want shipped and what parcels to use in shipping them. There is a maximum of 1000 parcels per quote request.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest case, this can be specified by a `parcel_attributes` field, which contains a list of Parcel specifications. Each item specifies the number, dimensions, and other information about the products being shipped, and the associated parcel. In this case, each parcel contains one type of product.\r\n\r\nFor more complex shipping arrangements, you can additionally specify a `product_attributes` field, which contains a list of Product specifications. In this case, the `parcel_attributes` will no longer contain product information such as `qty`. Each item under `product_attributes` would specify the number, dimensions, and other information about the products; while each item under `parcel_attributes` would separately specify the dimensions of the parcels. By mixing parcel and product specifications, you can define arbitrary groupings of products into parcels.\r\n\r\nThe number of parcels is further determined by the `Allocate each item in an order to a separate carton` setting in the Shippit administration page. If this is enabled, then each item will be assigned a separate parcel according to its dimensions. If this is disabled, then Shippit may combine multiple product or parcel specifications into one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Standard orders vs tracking orders\r\nIn a standard order, Shippit will book the courier given the provided information and provide tracking information and notifications for the merchant and recipient on the status of the order.\r\n\r\nIf you've already booked and allocated a courier to your consignment outside of Shippit, however, you can still use Shippit to provide tracking and notifications for the order. This is called a **tracking order**. In this case, you're only using Shippit for the tracking and notifications, and not for carrier booking.\r\n\r\nCreating a tracking order is the same as creating a standard order, only that you have to provide additional attributes so that Shippit can match the the courier's internal info to shippit. Note the following attributes:\r\n\r\n- `tracking_only` _required_ -- true - this makes this order a tracking order.\r\n- `courier_allocation` _required_ -- the name of the courier in charge of the item.\r\n- `courier_job_id` -- the ID assigned by some carriers to the shipment / consignment.\r\n- `parcel_attributes` -> `label_number` _required_ -- the label assigned by the carrier system to a parcel, used by Shippit to match the parcel number against the carrier's parcel number\r\n- `tracking_histories` -- one or two optional status events that will be added to the tracking page for the benefit of the recipient.\r\n\r\n#### Passing tracking histories\r\nIn a tracking order, you can choose to pass tracking histories for the benefit of the recipient. These are shown to the recipient in the tracking page to inform them of the status of when the order has been processed.\r\n\r\nThese items have just two fields, a `status` field and a `timestamp` in UTC format, to indicate to the recipient events  such as `order_placement` and `ready_for_pickup`. The `status` informs the user of the Order's state at that point in time and can be either `order_placed` or `ready_for_pickup`. The `timestamp` indicates when that change happened. The following tracking history entries are recommended to be placed:\r\n\r\n- `order_placed` - set to the time when you received the order on your system.\r\n- `ready_for_pickup` - set to the time when you book the order on Shippit.\r\n\r\nIf no `tracking_histories` entries are passed, Shippit will generate an initial tracking history for the order, set to `ready_for_pickup` at the point when Shippit received the API request.\r\n\r\n### Authority to leave\r\n* When using 500g satchels,\r\n  * When specifying ```No```, you must have ```Satchel 500g (A5)``` enabled in your settings (Settings > Pick & Pack > Automatic Package Sorting > Carrier Default Presets). \r\n  * When specifying ```Yes```, you must have ```Satchel 500g ATL (A5)``` enabled in your settings (Settings > Pick & Pack > Automatic Package Sorting > Carrier Default Presets).\r\n  * If nothing is specified, we assume ATL = ```No```\r\n\r\n* Note that the final ATL value also depends on how couriers are allocated and if users manually override the ATL option in the UI. It is important when confirming quotes that the ATL is set as desired.\r\n\r\n"

        The API first checks if the Order can be cancelled, ie., if its current
        state allows it, then returns an immediate response. If the Order is
        successfully cancelled, the API will answer with the Order with its
        state updated as `cancelled`. If it cannot be cancelled, it will throw a
        `422` error.

        This uses a pull-based model of Order tracking, which sends tracking

            Note that if a quote request to a carrier _can_ be generated, but
            one or more carriers cannot respond to the quote, then the quote
            request succeeds and this response is not given. The status of each
            individual quote would then be determined from the response body.
            This response is only returned when the quote request cannot be
            processed.


            If returned as text/html, will be blank.

        At minimum, a Quote requires a delivery location and information on the
        parcels being delivered. However, different couriers and delivery
        methods can require additional fields to satisfy their requirements.
        There is a maximum of 1000 parcels per quote request.


        ### Listing all quotes vs listing a single quote

        By default, Shippit will return a quote from the fastest / cheapest
        courier. However, for the purposes of showing different options, such as
        in a courier selection page, you may want to have Shippit display all
        quotes. To do this, pass the `return_all_quotes` field as true.


        Note that the quotes returned are filtered based on the requirements
        given by different couriers. Depending on the info submitted in the
        order and the carrier settings in the Shippit admin page, you may not
        see quotes from all configured carriers.

        ### Best practices for using webhooks


        **Event types**


        Your webhook implementation should be configured to action only the
        types of events required by your integration. Actioning for extra events
        (or all events) is not recommended as we may add new events at anytime


        **Handle duplicate events**


        Webhook endpoints might occasionally receive the same event more than
        once. We advise you to guard against duplicated event receipts by making
        your event processing idempotent. One way of doing this is logging the
        events you’ve processed, and then not processing already-logged events.


        **Order of events**


        Shippit does not guarantee delivery of events in the order in which they
        are generated.

            If you're creating orders by passing in `courier_type`, the courier
            will usually not be yet be assigned at order creation and you will
            get `null`. Courier allocation will be run as a background process
            depending on the merchant preferences, available couriers, and
            quotes returned by the couriers, which may take a few seconds to
            complete after order creation.


            If you're passing in a specific courier keyword in
            `courier_allocation`, this will reflect the courier that is
            specified.


            Note that the Shippit web user can also update the courier in

            determined from the LABEL call.


            If the quoted price is still `0` during the LABEL call, something

        ## parcels vs products

        How parcels relate to products is controlled by whether or not a
        **`product_attributes`** key is also defined. If a
        **`product_attributes`** is not defined, then the number of cartons is
        determined by the `Settings -> Pick & Pack -> Allocate each item in an
        order to a separate carton` option in Shippit, and the **`qty`** field
        will now specify either the number of parcels or products.


        If a **`product_attributes`** key is specified in the request, then the
        products can be specified separately from the parcels. In which case,
        the **`qty`** field should not be present: each parcel attributes object
        represents a separate parcel, and the number of products is specified in
        the **`product_attributes`** key. There is a maximum of 1000 parcels per
        request.

            This is used when the order is a tracking order, to match the parcel
            number in a carrier against the parcel recorded in shippit.
          type: string

            There is a maximum of 1000 parcels per quote request.


            Should not be present if a `product_attributes` key is present in
            the request.


            If `Allocate each item in an order to a separate carton` is enabled
            in Shippit, a separate parcel is generated for each product listed.
          type: number

            If the merchant account was configured to have the label and packing
            slip combined into a single document, the `shipping_label` will
            print the label only without the packing slip.


            If the merchant account was configured to enable ZPL output, can
            contain an `encoded_label` field containing ZPL output.

            Depending on how the merchant account is configured, the number of
            parcels generated may not match the number of parcel attributes
            passed in. By default, Shippit will try to combine all parcel
            attributes into a single parcel with the sum of the weights.


            However, if `Allocate each item in an order to a separate carton` is
            enabled, then Shippit will generate one parcel entry for each parcel
            entry sent in.
