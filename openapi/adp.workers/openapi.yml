  description: |
    This is a generated connector for [ADP Workers API v2](https://developers.adp.com/articles/api/workers-v2-api) OpenAPI specification.
    The Workers API provides the capability to obtain a list of all workers in an organization and to get information about work assignments.
    A worker is a person who performs duties and responsibilities for an organization. In that capacity, a worker fills one or more positions via a work assignment. 
    For a given work assignment, a worker is related to the organization as an employee or contractor.
  version: 2.0.0

          description: This indicator is used to support the ability to say that one
            address is the same as another. For example, the address of a dependent
            is the same as that of a worker. If a given system supports this functionality,
            this field should be present and set to true. The meta component associated
            to an event that allows for the adding or changing of an address, should
            use the links array associated to the indicator to define the list of addresses
            from which the user can select to set the address in context to be the same
            as.

      description: List conditional dependencies of supported properties (readOnly,
        pattern, hidden, disallow etc.) of an attribute or an object. Dependencies can
        be defined using oneOf (OR) / allOf (AND) object. oneOf - successful if one
        of the conditions satisfies, allOf - successful if all the conditions satisfies.
        Refer API specification for dependencies context object syntax and rules. Dependencies
        context cannot be validated against context schema if dependencies is defined
        context JSON, because the dependencies JSON structure is dynamically defined
        for attributes and the not defined in the context schema. Attribute level properties
        and dependencies properties are mutually exclusive, example - readOnly property
        can be set either at attribute level or inside dependencies. If both hidden
        and disallow properties are set inside dependencies or at attribute level, hidden
        property takes precedence.
