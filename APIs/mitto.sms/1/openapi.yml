                    When set to true, the API call is in test mode and no actual
                    SMS is delivered. The response returns “test”: true. For
                    test calls, there is no id parameter in the response. When
                    set to false, you make the API call in production mode. The
                    system delivers an SMS, and returns the id parameter in the
                    response.
                      If you do not use this parameter , by default you make the API call in production mode.

                    Free-form text with which the sender identifies themselves
                    to the recipient. This is what the recipient will see as
                    from whom the message is. Can be a phone number, or the name
                    of the company or the service. NOTE - what you provide here
                    may not be shown to the customer depending on how carriers
                    choose to handle your message.
                  example: MITTO SMS
                to:
                  type: string
                  description: >
                    The number to which the message is sent. Numbers are
                    specified in E.164 format. 
                  example: '359898876737'

                  description: |
                    The body of the SMS message.
                      If the message contains characters outside the range of the GSM Standard and Extended tables, then you need to set the character encoding to Unicode (type=Unicode as a query parameter). For details, refer to Long SMSs and Changing the Default Encoding of the Message. 
                  example: >-
                    Due to the limitations of GSM/PDU standard, the body text of
                    an SMS message cannot be longer than 160 characters (70
                    characters if the text is Unicode format). MITTOs SMS API
                    overcomes this limitations by splitting larger messages into
                    several smaller messages, each of which conforms to that
                    standards. This operation is automatic and you do not have
                    to do anything when making the API request the process is
                    triggered automatically when the text entered in body of the
                    SMS (the body parameter of the request) exceeds the limit.
                type:
                  type: string
                  description: >
                    Character set in which the message body will be encoded. If
                    not specified, the default encoding (GSM) is used. For
                    Unicode, set type Unicode. For Binary, set type to be Byte.
                    For automatic detection set type to auto.
                  example: unicode

                    First metadata field for tagging the message. The metadata
                    is returned in the delivery report by the callback. It can
                    be any free-form text you consider appropriate. You can use
                    a different reference string for each message or tag
                    multiple messages with the same string and group them
                    together in this way. For details, refer to [Delivery
                    Reports](https://docs.mitto.ch/sms-use-cases/#retrieve-delivery-reports)

                    Message](https://docs.mitto.ch/sms-use-cases/#add-metadata-to-a-message).

                  description: >
                    Validity period of the SMS message in minutes. When a
                    message has not been delivered to the receiver at the first
                    attempt, subsequent delivery attempts will be made until the
                    validity period expires, after which the message is
                    discarded as undeliverable. If the specified validity period
                    is different from the validity period of the supplier, then
                    the shorter period is enforced. When not specified, the
                    validity of a message defaults to 2,880 minutes (48 hours).
                  example: 2879

                    When set to true it will send the message in Flash mode.
                    Flash SMS is when the SMS appears directly on the main
                    screen without user interaction, and is not automatically
                    stored in the inbox.
                  example: true

                    Free-form text with which the sender identifies themselves
                    to the recipient. This is what the recipient will see as
                    from whom the message is. Can be a phone number, or the name
                    of the company or the service. NOTE - what you provide here

                  description: >
                    A list of strings separated by commas. Each string is the
                    number to which your message is sent. Numbers are specified
                    in E.164 format. You can repeat the same phone number, and
                    the message will be sent to the number as many times as the
                    number is listed.
                  example: '359898876737'

                    The body of the SMS message.
                      If the message contains characters outside the range of the GSM Standard and Extended tables, then you need to set the character encoding to Unicode (type=Unicode as a query parameter). For details, refer to Long SMSs and Changing the Default Encoding of the Message. 
                  example: >-
                    Due to the limitations of GSM/PDU standard, the body text of
                    an SMS message cannot be longer than 160 characters (70
                    characters if the text is Unicode format). MITTOs SMS API
                    overcomes this limitations by splitting larger messages into
                    several smaller messages, each of which conforms to that
                    standards. This operation is automatic and you do not have
                    to do anything when making the API request the process is
                    triggered automatically when the text entered in body of the
                    SMS (the body parameter of the request) exceeds the limit.

                    Character set in which the message body will be encoded. If
                    not specified, the default encoding (GSM) is used. For
                    Unicode, set type Unicode. For Binary, set type to be Byte.
                    For automatic detection set type to auto.
                  example: unicode

                    First metadata field for tagging the message. The metadata
                    is returned in the delivery report by the callback. It can
                    be any free-form text you consider appropriate. You can use
                    a different reference string for each message or tag
                    multiple messages with the same string and group them
                    together in this way.

                    Validity period of the SMS message in minutes. When a
                    message has not been delivered to the receiver at the first
                    attempt, subsequent delivery attempts will be made until the
                    validity period expires, after which the message is
                    discarded as undeliverable. If the specified validity period
                    is different from the validity period of the supplier, then
                    the shorter period is enforced. When not specified, the
                    validity of a message defaults to 2,880 minutes (48 hours).
                  example: 2879

                    When set to true it will send the message in Flash mode.
                    Flash SMS is when the SMS appears directly on the main
                    screen without user interaction, and is not automatically
                    stored in the inbox.
