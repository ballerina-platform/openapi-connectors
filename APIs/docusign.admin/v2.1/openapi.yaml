        Your CSV import file is made up of a header row with the column headers and a row of user or account data for each user you want to add to an account. Only new users can be imported. Any changes to existing users will be ignored. To make changes to existing users, use `updateBulkUserImports`.

        To ensure your CSV is properly formatted, use the
        [Sample Bulk Add CSV file](https://admin.docusign.com/static-resources/organization-user-import.csv)
         as a template. The following table describes the columns.

        Bulk updates information for existing users.

        - Required scopes: `user_write`



        Your CSV import file is made up of a header row with the column headers and a row of user or account data for each user you want to add to an account. Only new users can be imported. Any changes to existing users will be ignored. To make changes to existing users, use `updateBulkUserImports`.

        **Update limit**: You can update up to 2,000 users on an account and include up to 50 accounts per import. The maximum number of updated users per import is 8,000.

        This method requires the following HTTP headers:

        | Header | Value |
        | :--- |  :--- |
        | Content-Type | `text/csv` |
        | Content-Disposition |  `filename=filename.csv` |



        To ensure your CSV is properly formatted, use the
        [Sample Bulk Update CSV file](https://admin.docusign.com/static-resources/organization-user-update-import.csv)
         as a template. The following table describes the columns.

        Note that the columns for bulk adding users and bulk update users are slightly different.
        The update CSV file requires an `APIUserName` column, and does not have an `AutoActivate` column.

        ## Updating user email addresses

        Changing a user's email address should be done carefully. The user's email address is used to log in to DocuSign and receive documents to sign from others.
        Once changed, existing documents that were sent or received:

        - Will still appear in the user's documents list.
        - Notifications about these documents will be sent to the new email address. If someone sends a new document to the old email address:
        - DocuSign will send a notification to the old address.
        - It will not appear in the documents list of the account.

        This change of email address will be applied to all of the user's account memberships.

        - Required scopes: `user_write`

        Given a CSV list of users, close their accounts.


        Your CSV import file is made up of a header row with the column headers and a row of user or account data for each user whose account you want to close.

        To ensure your CSV is properly formatted, use the
        [Sample Bulk Update CSV file](https://admin.docusign.com/static-resources/organization-user-update-import.csv)
         as a template. The following table describes the columns.
