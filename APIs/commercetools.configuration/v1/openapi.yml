            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the current version of the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete it) is different from that provided in the request.
            In response to this, the client will usually want to request the newest version of the resource to see what has been changed and decide what changes to apply to the newest version.

            A 409 Conflict indicates a concurrent modification and usually occurs on a versioned resource, which requires the client to provide the version of the resource to perform a change.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the current version of the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete it) is different from that provided in the request.
            In response to this, the client will usually want to request the newest version of the resource to see what has been changed and decide what changes to apply to the newest version.

            A 409 Conflict indicates a concurrent modification and usually occurs on a versioned resource, which requires the client to provide the version of the resource to perform a change.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the current version of the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete it) is different from that provided in the request.
            In response to this, the client will usually want to request the newest version of the resource to see what has been changed and decide what changes to apply to the newest version.

            A 409 Conflict indicates a concurrent modification and usually occurs on a versioned resource, which requires the client to provide the version of the resource to perform a change.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the current version of the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete it) is different from that provided in the request.
            In response to this, the client will usually want to request the newest version of the resource to see what has been changed and decide what changes to apply to the newest version.

            A 409 Conflict indicates a concurrent modification and usually occurs on a versioned resource, which requires the client to provide the version of the resource to perform a change.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.

                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the current version of the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete it) is different from that provided in the request.
            In response to this, the client will usually want to request the newest version of the resource to see what has been changed and decide what changes to apply to the newest version.

            A 409 Conflict indicates a concurrent modification and usually occurs on a versioned resource, which requires the client to provide the version of the resource to perform a change.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the current version of the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete it) is different from that provided in the request.
            In response to this, the client will usually want to request the newest version of the resource to see what has been changed and decide what changes to apply to the newest version.

            A 409 Conflict indicates a concurrent modification and usually occurs on a versioned resource, which requires the client to provide the version of the resource to perform a change.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the current version of the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete it) is different from that provided in the request.
            In response to this, the client will usually want to request the newest version of the resource to see what has been changed and decide what changes to apply to the newest version.

            A 409 Conflict indicates a concurrent modification and usually occurs on a versioned resource, which requires the client to provide the version of the resource to perform a change.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.
