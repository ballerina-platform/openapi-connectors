        The <a

        is a JSON

        string that describes to the Full Stack SDK all the experiments and

            the experiment is paused, your changes will not be visible to
            visitors when you publish. `start` makes your experiment live to all
            visitors who are in your targeted audience and changes the status to
            `running`. `pause` stops the experiment and changes the status to
            `paused`. No new visitors will see a `paused` experiment until you
            restart it. See [Differences among publish, start, and
            pause](https://help.optimizely.com/Get_Started/Differences_among_publish%2C_start%2C_and_pause)
            for details. `resume` resumes the experiment from a paused status
            without publishing any new changes. Status will be `running`.
            `unarchive` unarchives an archived experiment. Status will be
            `paused`.

            expression match for the attribute value. The default match_type is

            'Immediate' activation mode activates the page as soon as the

            Stringified array of the conditions that activate the Page. The
            array contains Page Condition JSON dicts joined by "and" and "or".

            Each individual Page Condition dict has format {"type": "url",
            "match_type": <match_type>, "value": <value>} where match_types are:

            "simple" match type will match if "value" matches the hostname and
            path of the Page URL.

            "exact" match type will match only an exact string match between
            "value" and the Page URL.

            "substring" match type will match if "value" is a substring of the
            Page URL.

            "regex" match type will match if "value" is a regular expression
            match for the Page URL.

        (BETA) A string representation of a JSON Segment Conditions Expression.
        This parameter can be either URL-escaped stringified JSON or
        Base64-encoded stringified JSON using URL-safe alphabet (preferred).

        Segment Conditions Expressions consist of Logical Expressions and Match
        Expressions.

        Logical Expressions are represented as an array of the format
        [<operator>, <expression>...], where the supported operators are "and",
        "or" and "not".

        Match Expressions are represented as an object of the format
        {"attribute_id": <attribute_id>, "attribute_value": <value>[,
        "match_type": <match_type>]}, where supported values for match_type are
        "exact" match type will match only an exact string match between "value"
        string and the attribute value. "substring" match type will match if
        "value" is a substring of the attribute value. "prefix" match type will
        match if "value" is a string prefix of the attribute value. "regex"
        match type will match if "value" is a regular expression match for the
        attribute value. The default match_type is "exact".

        Campaign: Contains users that arrive on a URL containing a
        'utm_campaign,' 'utm_source,' 'gclid,' or 'otm_source' query parameter.
        If the URL contains one of these parameters, the visitor will count as
        "Campaign" traffic even if they arrived through search.

        Direct:  Includes all users who do not have any external referrer in
        their URL.

        Referral: Includes all users that come from another URL that doesn't
        count as Campaign.
