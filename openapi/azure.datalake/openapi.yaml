          Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. The value is
          a comma-separated list of access control entries that fully replaces the
          existing access control list (ACL).  Each access control entry (ACE) consists
          of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format
          "[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]". The scope must be "default" to indicate
          the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit
          and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: "user"
          grants rights to the owner or a named user, "group" grants rights to the
          owning group or a named group, "mask" restricts rights granted to named
          users and the members of groups, and "other" grants rights to all users
          not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted
          for entries of type "mask" and "other".  The user or group identifier is
          also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a
          3-character sequence where the first character is ''r'' to grant read access,
          the second character is ''w'' to grant write access, and the third character
          is ''x'' to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the ''-''
          character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example,
          the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner
          and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to
          everyone else: "user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask=rwx".
