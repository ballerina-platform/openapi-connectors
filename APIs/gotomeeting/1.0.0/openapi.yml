        multiple sessions if the organizer stopped and restarted the meeting for
        any reason, such as their device of choice did not work. Recurring
        meetings are at least one session per event. The call removes the

        attendee list, and any recordings. The meeting will still appear in your
        organizer's Meeting History, but will have no associated sessions. NOTE:
        The delete occurs at the session level because this provides the
        greatest granular control. To delete for a specific meetingID, you would
        need to accumualate all sessions for the meeting and apply the delete.

        Use this call to clean up your data by deleting the attendee list for a
        specific session. The sessionID(s) and the number of attendees at each
        session is included by meeting in the Get Historical Meetings call. Each
        meeting held is at least one session. One meeting may be multiple
        sessions if the organizer stopped and restarted the meeting for any
        reason, such as their device of choice did not work. Recurring meetings
        are at least one session per event. The call removes the attendee list
        from the session from LogMeIn's servers. You can remove the entire
        session data using the Delete Session call, or delete recordings of the
        meeting using the Delete Session Recordings call. The meeting will still
        appear in your organizer's Meeting History, but will have no associated
        attendees. NOTE: The delete occurs at the session level because this
        provides the greatest granular control. To delete for a specific
        meetingID, you would need to accumulate all sessions for the meeting
        and apply the delete.
