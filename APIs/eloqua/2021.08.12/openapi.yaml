      summary: Create an email address import definition
      description: Creates a new email address import definition. The Bulk API's emailAddresses
        import allows you to change the global subscription status of email addresses
        without having to create a contact. The global subscription status can only
        be changed to unsubscribed. When an email address is imported this way, any
        present or future contact in Eloqua with the same email address will be automatically
        globally unsubscribed. Alternatively, to globally subscribe an email address,
        the /contacts/imports and /contacts/exports endpoints can be used with a sync
        action.
