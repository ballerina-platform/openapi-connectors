        Example metrics include Seconds to Resolve, Seconds to Engage, Snoozed Seconds, and Sleep Hour Interruptions. Some metric definitions can be found in our [Knowledge Base](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/pagerduty-analytics).
        Data can be aggregated by day, week or month in addition to by service, or provided just as a collection of aggregates for each service in the dataset for the entire period.  If a unit is provided, each row in the returned dataset will include a 'range_start' timestamp.

        Retrieve a list top-level Business Services sorted by highest Impact with `status` included.
        When called without the `ids[]` parameter, this endpoint does not return an exhaustive list of Business Services but rather provides access to the most impacted up to the limit of 200.

        The returned Business Services are sorted first by Impact, secondarily by most recently impacted, and finally by name.

        To get impact information about a specific set of Business Services, use the `ids[]` parameter.

          Set the `id` and `order` of the global Priority Threshold. These values can be obtained by calling the `/priorities` endpoint.

          Once set, Incidents must be at or above the specified level in order to impact Business Services.  An exception to this rule is if the Incident has been added to the incident directly using the `PUT /incidents/{id}/business_services/{business_service_id}/impacts` endpoint.

        Resolve multiple alerts or associate them with different incidents.

        An incident represents a problem or an issue that needs to be addressed and resolved. An alert represents a digital signal that was emitted to PagerDuty by the monitoring systems that detected or identified the issue.

        A maximum of 500 alerts may be updated at a time. If more than this number of alerts are given, the API will respond with status 413 (Request Entity Too Large).

        List related Change Events for an Incident, as well as the reason these changes are correlated with the incident.

        Change events represent service changes such as deploys, build completion, and configuration changes, providing information that is critical during incident triage or hypercare. For more information on change events, see [Change Events](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/change-events).

        The Change Correlation feature provides incident responders with recent change events that are most relevant to that incident. Change Correlation informs the responder why a particular change event was surfaced and correlated to an incident based on three key factors which include time, related service, or intelligence (machine learning).

      summary: Update an Event Rule
      description: |
        Update an Event Rule. Note that the endpoint supports partial updates, so any number of the writable fields can be provided.

        Rulesets allow you to route events to an endpoint and create collections of Event Rules, which define sets of actions to take based on event content.

        For more information see the [API Concepts Document](../../docs/CONCEPTS.md#rulesets)

        Note: Create and Update on rules will accept 'description' or 'summary' interchangeably as an extraction action target. Get and List on rules will always return 'summary' as the target. If you are expecting 'description' please change your automation code to expect 'summary' instead.

        You cannot remove a past override.

        If the override is truncated, the status code will be 200 OK, as opposed to a 204 No Content for a successful delete.

        Get impacted Business Services for a Status Dashboard by `id`

        This endpoint does not return an exhaustive list of Business Services but rather provides access to the most impacted on the specified Status Dashboard up to the limit of 200.

        To get Impact information about a specific Business Service on the Status Dashboard that does not appear in the Impact-sorted response, use the `ids[]` parameter on the `/business_services/impacts` endpoint.

        Succeeds only if the team has no associated Escalation Policies, Services, Schedules and Subteams.

        All associated unresovled incidents will be reassigned to another team (if specified) or will loose team association, thus becoming account-level (with visibility implications).

        Note that the incidents reassignment process is asynchronous and has no guarantee to complete before the API call return.

        Returns 400 if the user has assigned incidents unless your [pricing plan](https://www.pagerduty.com/pricing) has the `offboarding` feature and the account is [configured](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/offboarding#section-additional-configurations) appropriately.

        Note that the incidents reassignment process is asynchronous and has no guarantee to complete before the api call return.

        [*Learn more about `offboarding` feature*](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/offboarding).
