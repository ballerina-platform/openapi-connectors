      description: >
        Schedules a training of one or more sessions. You can only add organizers to
        a training if you have a multi-user account. Once a training has been
        created with this method, you can accept registrations to the training.
        Registration is for the entire training - all sessions. (The
        GoToTraining admin site enables you to create trainings that allow
        participants to register for individual sessions as well as
        automatically create weekly or monthly events.) Registration settings
        controls whether you allow web registration for this training, and
        whether a confirmation email is sent to the registrant following
        registration. Disabling the confirmation email is an API-only setting.
        If the user registers through the GoToTraining website, a confirmation
        email is sent. If the user is manually approved by the training
        administrator through the GoToTraining web site, the confirmation email
        is sent. It is recommended that you disable web registration if you
        disable confirmation emails. The response contains a trainingKey for the
        scheduled training.
