  - name: Activities
    description: |
      Activities are appointments/tasks/events on a calendar that can be associated with a Deal, a Person and an Organization. Activities can be of different type (such as call, meeting, lunch or a custom type - see ActivityTypes object) and can be assigned to a particular User. Note that activities can also be created without a specific date/time.
  - name: ActivityFields
    description: |
      ActivityFields represent different fields that Activity has.
  - name: ActivityTypes
    description: |
      ActivityTypes represent different kinds of activities that can be stored. Each ActivityType is presented to the user with an icon and a name. Additionally, a color can be defined (not implemented in the Pipedrive app as of today). ActivityTypes are linked to Activities via `ActivityType.key_string = Activity.type`. The `key_string` will be generated by the API based on the given name of the ActivityType upon creation, and cannot be changed. ActivityTypes should be presented to the user in an ordered manner, using the `ActivityType.order_nr` value.
  - name: CallLogs
    description: |
      Call logs describe the outcome of a phone call managed by an integrated provider. Since these logs are also considered activities, they can be associated with a Deal, a Person and/or an Organization. Call logs do differ from other activities, as they only receive the information needed to describe the phone call.
  - name: Currencies
    description: |
      Supported currencies which can be used to represent the monetary value of a Deal, or a value of any monetary type custom field. The `Currency.code` field must be used to point to a currency. `Currency.code` is the ISO-4217 format currency code for non-custom currencies. You can differentiate custom and non-custom currencies using the `is_custom_flag` property. For custom currencies, it is intended that the formatted sums are displayed in the UI using the following format: [sum][non-breaking space character][currency.symbol], for example: 500 users. Custom currencies cannot be added or removed via the API yet — rather the admin users of the account must configure them from the Pipedrive app.
  - name: DealFields
    description: |
      DealFields represent the near-complete schema for a Deal in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their Deals, with various custom fields. In the context of using DealFields as a schema for defining the data fields of a Deal, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate DealFields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of DealFields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one Deal and list its keys."
  - name: Deals
    description: |
      Deals represent ongoing, lost or won sales to an Organization or to a Person. Each deal has a monetary value and must be placed in a Stage. Deals can be owned by a User, and followed by one or many Users. Each Deal consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. The custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys. These hashes can be mapped against `DealField.key`. The corresponding label for each such custom field can be obtained from `DealField.name`.
  - name: Files
    description: |
      Files are documents of any kind (images, spreadsheets, text files, etc.) that are uploaded to Pipedrive, and usually associated with a particular Deal, Person, Organization, Product, Note or Activity. Remote files can only be associated with a particular Deal, Person or Organization. Note that the API currently does not support downloading files although it lets you retrieve a file’s meta-info along with a URL which can be used to download the file by using a standard HTTP GET request.
  - name: Filters
    description: |
      Each filter is essentially a set of data validation conditions. A filter of the same kind can be applied when fetching list of Deals, Persons, Organizations, Products or Deals in the context of a Pipeline. When applied, only items matching the conditions of the filter are returned. Detailed definitions of filter conditions and additional functionality is not yet available.
  - name: GlobalMessages

  - name: Goals
    description: |
      Goals help your team meet your sales targets. There are three types of goals - company, team and user.
  - name: ItemSearch
    description: |
      Ordered reference objects, pointing to either Deals, Persons, Organizations, Leads, Products, Files or Mail Attachments.
  - name: LeadLabels
    description: |
      Lead labels allow you to visually categorize your leads. There are three default lead labels: hot, cold, and warm, but you can add as many new custom labels as you want.
  - name: LeadSources
    description: |
      Lead source indicates, where you lead came from. Currently, these are the possible lead sources: `Manually created`, `Deal`, `Web Forms`, `Prospector`, `Chatbot`, `Live Chat`, `Import`, `Web Visitors`, `Workflow Automation`, and `API`. Lead sources are pre-defined and cannot be edited.
  - name: Leads
    description: |
      Leads are potential deals stored in Leads Inbox before they are archived or converted to a Deal. Each Lead needs to be named (using the `title` field) and be linked to a Person or an Organization. In addition to that, a Lead can contain most of the fields a Deal can (such as `value` or `expected_close_date`).
  - name: Mailbox
    description: |
      Mailbox was designed to be the email control hub inside Pipedrive. Pipedrive supports all major providers (including Gmail, Outlook and also custom IMAP/SMTP). There are 2 options for syncing user emails: 2-way sync: Mail Connection is established with the mail provider (example Gmail). There can be only 1 active Mail Connection per user in company. 1-way sync: SmartBCC feature which stores the copies of email messages to Pipedrive by adding the SmartBCC specific address to mail recipients.
  - name: NoteFields
    description: |
      NoteFields represent different fields that Note has.
  - name: Notes
    description: |
      Notes are pieces of textual (HTML-formatted) information that can be attached to Deals, Persons and Organizations. Notes are usually displayed in the UI in chronological order – newest first – and in context with other updates regarding the item they are attached to. The maximum note size is approximately 3,000,000 characters (or 3MB per note).
  - name: OrganizationFields
    description: |
      OrganizationFields represent the near-complete schema for an Organization in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their Organizations, with various custom fields. In the context of using OrganizationFields as a schema for defining the data fields of an Organization, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate OrganizationFields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of OrganizationFields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key 'ffk9s9' stored on the account, 'ffk9s9' would hold the numeric value of the field, and 'ffk9s9_currency' would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one Organization and list its keys.
  - name: OrganizationRelationships
  - name: Organizations
    description: |
      Organizations are companies and other kinds of organizations you are making Deals with. Persons can be associated with organizations so that each organization can contain one or more Persons.
  - name: PermissionSets
  - name: PersonFields
    description: |
      PersonFields represent the near-complete schema for a Person in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their Persons, with various custom fields. In the context of using PersonFields as a schema for defining the data fields of a Person, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate PersonFields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of PersonFields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one Person and list its keys.
  - name: Persons
    description: |
      Persons are your contacts, the customers you are doing Deals with. Each Person can belong to an Organization. Persons should not be confused with Users.
  - name: Pipelines
    description: |
      Pipelines are essentially ordered collections of Stages.
  - name: ProductFields
    description: |
      ProductFields represent the near-complete schema for a Product in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their Products, with various custom fields. In the context of using ProductFields as a schema for defining the data fields of a Product, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate ProductFields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of ProductFields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one Product and list its keys.
  - name: Products
    description: |
      Products are the goods or services you are dealing with. Each product can have N different price points - first, each Product can have a price in N different currencies, and secondly, each Product can have N variations of itself, each having N prices different currencies. Note that only one price per variation per currency is supported. Products can be instantiated to Deals. In the context of instatiation, a custom price, quantity, duration and discount can be applied.

Also note that custom fields appear as long hashes in the resulting data. These hashes can be mapped against the `key` value of dealFields.

      summary: Add a new filter
      description: 'Adds a new filter, returns the ID upon success. Note that in the conditions JSON object only one first-level condition group is supported, and it must be glued with ''AND'', and only two second level condition groups are supported of which one must be glued with ''AND'' and the second with ''OR''. Other combinations do not work (yet) but the syntax supports introducing them in future.

It requires a minimum structure as follows: {"glue":"and","conditions":[{"glue":"and","conditions": [CONDITION_OBJECTS]},{"glue":"or","conditions":[CONDITION_OBJECTS]}]}. Replace CONDITION_OBJECTS with JSON objects of the following structure: {"object":"","field_id":"", "operator":"","value":"", "extra_value":""} or leave the array empty. Depending on the object type you should use another API endpoint to get field_id. There are five types of objects you can choose from: "person", "deal", "organization", "product", "activity" and you can use these types of operators depending on what type of a field you have: "IS NOT NULL", "IS NULL", "<=", ">=", "<", ">", "!=", "=", "LIKE ''%$%''", "NOT LIKE ''%$%''", "LIKE ''$%''", "NOT LIKE ''$%''", "LIKE ''%$''", "NOT LIKE ''%$''".

Replace CONDITION_OBJECTS with JSON objects of the following structure: {"object":"","field_id":"", "operator":"","value":"", "extra_value":""} or leave the array empty. Depending on the object type you should use another API endpoint to get field_id. There are five types of objects you can choose from: "person", "deal", "organization", "product", "activity" and you can use these types of operators depending on what type of a field you have: "IS NOT NULL", "IS NULL", "<=", ">=", "<", ">", "!=", "=", "LIKE ''%$%''", "NOT LIKE ''%$%''", "LIKE ''$%''", "NOT LIKE ''$%''", "LIKE ''%$''", "NOT LIKE ''%$''".

      description: |
        Returns multiple Leads. Leads are sorted by the time they were created, from oldest to newest. Pagination can be controlled using `limit` and `start` query parameters. If a Lead contains custom fields, the fields' values will be included in the response in the same format as with the `Deals` endpoints. If a custom field's value hasn't been set for the Lead, it won't appear in the response. Please note that Leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fields' structure from Deals.
