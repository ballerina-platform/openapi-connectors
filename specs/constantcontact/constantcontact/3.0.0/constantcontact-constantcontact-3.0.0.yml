      description: |-
        This multipart method creates an asynchronous background job that adds or updates contacts by importing a CSV file containing contact information. Do not use a Content-Type header value with this method.

        Importing a new contact automatically sets the contact's `permission_to_send` property as `implicit` and the `opt_in_source` property as `Account`. Importing an existing contact only updates the contact properties you include in the request.

        The CSV file has a maximum of 40,000 lines including the header row (39,999 contacts) and a maximum file size of 4 megabytes (MB).  Lines above the 40,000 line maximum are not processed. If the request body exceeds 4 MB, only the contacts contained in the first 4 MB are imported and the remaining data is dropped.

                    You can also use custom fields as column headings. Enter the custom field name prefixed with `cf:` as the column heading. For example, use `cf:first_name` as the header name if you have a custom field named "first_name". The custom field must already exist in the Constant Contact account you are using. Depending on the custom field data type, you can enter dates or strings as the value of the custom field. Each contact can contain up to 25 different custom fields.

        Use this method to create an asynchronous background job that adds new contacts or updates existing contacts by importing a JSON payload. This method requires a request body that contains the contact data you are importing and the contact lists you are adding all imported contacts to.

        Importing a new contact automatically sets the contact's `permission_to_send` property as `implicit` and the `opt_in_source` property as `Account`. Importing an existing contact only updates the contact properties you include in the request.

        You can import custom fields by prefixing a custom field name with `cf:` and adding it as a contact property. For example, use the property name `cf:first_name` if you have a custom field named first_name. The custom field must already exist in the Constant Contact account you are using. Each contact can contain up to 25 custom fields.

      description: |-
        Use this method to create a new segment. You create segments to target a subset of your contacts that meet your specific criteria for a marketing campaign. The segment `name` must be unique. The `segment_criteria` requires single-string escaped JSON. Constant Contact uses the contact data that you specify in the `segment_criteria` to evaluate and identify the contacts you want to target. Contact data can be grouped from different data sources, including:

          -  **`tracking`**: Supports **or** and **and** groups.


          -  **`contact`**: Supports **or** and **and** groups.


          -  **`list_membership`**: Supports **or** groups.

          -  **`tags`**: Supports **or** groups.

        If you do not specify `list_membership` as criteria, Constant Contact evaluates all contacts in your account. To avoid returning a 400 error response, when specifying the `segment_criteria` do not request more than 500 email campaigns or a date range greater than 1825 days (5 years) be evaluated.

For example, you can search by the contact's `email` address, `status`, `lists` memberships, `segment_id`, `tags`, `notes` and `updated_after` date. Use the `limit` query parameter to limit the number of results returned per page. Use the `include` query parameter to include contact sub-resources in the response and `include_count` to include the total number of contacts that meet your specified search criteria.

        By default, this method returns all contacts that are not deleted. Use the `status` query parameter with the value `all` to return all contacts including deleted contacts.

        <div class="Msg Msg--warning"><p class="note-text">Use this endpoint to migrate your locally stored V2 contact ids to the new V3 format. Developers are expected to use this endpoint sparingly. This endpoint is NOT intended for regular or repeated use. Constant Contact will eventually deprecate and remove this endpoint.</p></div>

        This GET call retrieves a collection of cross-referenced contact sequence IDs (`id` used in the V2 API) and UUIDs (`contact_id` used in the V3 API). This endpoint is intended for developers who have an existing V2 API integration, and are migrating their users to a new V3 API integration. The V2 and V3 APIs use different resource ID formats. Use the `sequence_ids` query parameter to specify a set of comma delimited V2 contacts ids to cross-referenced with their V3 `contact_ids`. See [Migrating to V3](/api_guide/migration_overview.html) to learn more.

        Use this method to update an email campaign activity by including the complete email campaign activity with your changes in the request body. The request body requires the `from_name`, `from_email`, `reply_to_email`, and `subject` properties.

        You can only update email campaign activities that have the `primary_email` role and that are in `DRAFT` or `Done` status.
        When you use a PUT method to update a resource, the V3 API overwrites any properties that are missing in the request body. However, the V3 API does not overwrite subresources that you omit in the request body or missing properties in subresources. This method considers `physical_address_in_footer`, `document_properties`, `html_content`, and `permalink_url` subresources of the email campaign activity.

Dynamic content includes contact and custom field variables.

        You can send up to 50 test emails each day. Each recipient you add to the `email_addresses` array in the request body counts towards this limit. Successfully sending a test email returns a 204 response code without a response body.

        Use this POST method to create a new Constant Contact client account under your partner account, set up the billing plan for the account, and to add the new client to the default contact list.

        Newly created accounts are free trials which give the user up to 60 days to try Constant Contact before buying. Trial accounts have limits depending on the services that are included.

        If a field validation error occurs, a 400 response message is returned.

        If provisioning does not complete successfully due to unavailable dependencies, such as database or dependent services, a 503 response message is returned. By default, the client account provision data is stored and processed when provisioning becomes available.

        Some client account features will be supported in future releases, such as Single Sign On (SSO).

      summary: PUT (update) Billing Plan Details for a Client Account
      description: |-
        Use this PUT method to update the type of billing plan to assign to the Constant Contact client account. The type of billing plan determines which Constant Contact product features that the client account can access. The billing plan type (`plan_type`) that you enter must already exist in the plan group. Attempting to change to a plan that is currently not available within your partner plan group results in a 400 error response code.

        When you create a new client account, the `plan_type` defaults to `TRIAL` and the `billing_day_of_month` defaults to `null`. The `billing_day_of_month` property is required if a client account is not set up to use single billing. You can change the day of month (`billing_day_of_month`) in which to bill a client account only when changing the `plan_type` value from `TRIAL` to a different `plan_type`, otherwise the `billing_day_of_month` value you enter is ignored. You can choose to enter a specific day of the month or accept the default value, which is the day on which the `plan_type` value changes from a `TRIAL` plan to a different `plan_type`. Changing the `plan_type` from `TRIAL` to another `plan_type` automatically changes the `billing_status` from `Trial` to `Open`.


        Only technology partners can access partner endpoints and partner endpoints cannot be tested using the API reference tester.

          If updating from a `TRIAL` plan (`plan_type`) to another type of billing plan, you have the option to update the day of month (`billing_day_of_month`) in which to bill the client account. Valid values include `1` through to and including `31`. Any additional billing plan properties and values that you include in the request body are ignored.

          ```
        </br>
        If your application does not return a success response after receiving a notification, Constant Contact will retry sending the POST notification at 1 minute intervals for up to an hour.
