      description: |
        Self-issued access tokens (described in user-facing copy as integration tokens) are explicitly designed for desktop integrations where implementing browser-based authentication is non-trivial, or software like plugins where it is impossible to secure a client secret. You should not request that a user give you an integration token if you don’t meet these criteria. Users will be cautioned within Medium to treat integration tokens like passwords, and dissuaded from making them generally available.

        Users can generate an access token from the [Settings page](https://medium.com/me/settings) of their Medium account.

        You should instruct your user to visit this URL and generate an integration token from the Integration Tokens section. You should suggest a description for this token - typically the name of your product or feature - and use it consistently for all users.

        Self-issued access tokens currently grant the `basicProfile` and `publishPost` scope. A future iteration of the API will require a user to select the scope they wish to grant access to.

        Self-issued access tokens do not expire, though they may be revoked by the user at any time.

      description: First you must register an application on Medium. Then we will
        supply you a clientId and a clientSecret with which you may access Medium’s

        should be treated like a password and stored securely.

            basicProfile: Grants basic access to a user’s profile (not including their
              email).
            listPublications: Grants the ability to list publications related to the
              user.
            publishPost: Grants the ability to publish a post to the user’s profile.
            uploadImage: "Grants the ability to upload an image for use within a Medium\
