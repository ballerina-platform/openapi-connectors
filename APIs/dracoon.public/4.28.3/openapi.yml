        ### Description:
        Finalize (chunked) upload via Upload Share.

        ### Precondition:
        Valid upload ID.  
        Only returns users that owns one of the following permissions: <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage download share</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage upload share</span>

        ### Postcondition:
        Finalizes upload.

        ### Further Information:
        Chunked uploads (range requests) are supported.  

        Please ensure that all chunks have been transferred correctly before finishing the upload.  
        If file hash has been created in time a `201 Created` will be responded and hash will be part of response, otherwise it will be a `202 Accepted` without it.
