        Podcast hosting services can use this endpoint to help your users directly submit a new podcast to Listen Notes database. If the podcast doesn't exist in the database, "status" in the response will be "in review", and we'll review it within 12 hours. If the podcast exists, "status" in the response will be "found". You can use `POST /podcasts` to check if multiple podcasts exist in the database. If you want to get a notification once the podcast is accepted, you can either specify the "email" parameter or configure a webhook url in the dashboard: listennotes.com/api/dashboard/#webhooks
